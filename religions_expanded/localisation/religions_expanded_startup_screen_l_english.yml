These Aspects have a cooldown of either §Y10§! or §Y20 years§! and give you a countrywide or areawide bonus while also removing one building in a randomly selected, matching province. \n\nSince Church Aspects are a Vanilla DLC locked mechanic, to use this mechanic the £DLC_cs£ §YCommon Sense§! DLC is required.\n"
 re_startup_text_hinduism: "§YHindu§! is a Vanilla §lDharmic§! faith. Its mechanic has been changed. \n\n§YHindu§! still uses the §YDeities§! mechanic: \n\n\n£re_startup_screen_icon_hindu_mechanic£ \n\n\n\nHowever the mechanic has been expanded. The deities picked via the Vanilla system are now considered §YMinor Deities§!.

(£adm£), §YVishnu§! (£dip£) and §YShiva§! (£mil£). The Major Deity can be chosen and swapped freely, but the dedication for a Major deity only grows while it's active. There are six levels of dedication in total per Major Deity. When the dedication progress reaches §Y100.0%§!, the next level is selected and the progress is reset to §Y0.0%§!. If you lose dedication, you can also lose a dedication level. \n\nEvery §Y2 years§! you can use the interaction '§YReset Minor Deity§!' to unselect your current §YMinor Deity§!. \nEvery §Y20 years§! you can use the interaction '§YSpend Dedication§!', which costs §R30§! dedication of the current active Major Deity and grants you a bonus for §Y20 years§!. The bonus depends on who your current Major Deity is. \nYou can enable and deable a toggle, the '§YDedication Focus§!', which grants Monthly Level of Dedication Progress for the current active Major Deity in exchange for maluses. The higher your dedication is, the smaller the bonus and the higher the maluses will be. Disabling the toggle will also have negative consequences that become harsher the higher your dedication is. \n\nSince Deities are a Vanilla DLC locked mechanic and the mechanic was expanded upon, the £DLC_won£ §YWealth of Nations§! DLC is still required.\n"
