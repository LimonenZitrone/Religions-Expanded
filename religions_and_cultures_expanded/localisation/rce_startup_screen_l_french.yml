Each ruler has its own Studies' Progress. The first teaching can be picked from the beginning of the ruler's reign. Any consecutive teaching can be picked, whenever the ruler reaches §Y100.0%§! Studies' Progress. When picking a teaching, you can select one out of three modifiers. After selecting a teaching, the Studies' Progress is reset to §Y0.00%§!. \nAll selected teaching modifiers stay active until the ruler dies. Once the ruler has picked all four teachings, an additional bonus to average ruler lifespan is applied. \n\nEvery §Y6 years§! you can use the interaction '§YMeditate§!'

(inner left button), which costs §R75§! Sylvan Affinity and grants a bonus to a random owned province and its area for §Y5 years§!. The bonus is different depending on the selected Seasonal Affinity."
 rce_startup_text_nestorian: "§YNestorian§! is a §lChristian§! faith that is situated in Asia. Converting to §YNestorian§! is possible via a decision when having §YAssyrian§! as primary culture and having a §lChristian§! or §lDharmic§! religion or when having a §lChristian§! religion and §YNestorian§! as dominant religion as well as via rebels. \n\n§YNestorian§! has the following base modifiers: \n   [trade_efficiency]: §G+10.0%§! \n   [missionaries]: §G+1§! \n\n§YNestorian§! uses the §YNestorian Patriarchy§! mechanic: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n£rce_startup_screen_icon_nestorian_patriarchy_mechanic£ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe §YNestorian Patriarchy§! mechanic gives access to the Patriarchy, which is somewhat similar to the Vanilla Papacy. Similar to [PAP.GetName] for that, the Nestorian Patriarchy is @NPA §Y[NPA.GetName]§!. If it exists, the death of its ruler triggers a new selection of the Patriarchy Controller. Otherwise the ruler will be simulated to ensure the Controller changes even without the Patriarchy country existing. \n[This.RceGetReligionMechanicNestorianPatriarchyPatriarchyControllerBonuses]  \n\nThe §YPatriarchy Controller§! also gains access to the ability to pick a §YCenter of Conversion§! that is active until the next Controller is picked or the Controller was forced by war to destroy it. \nOnce selected, the Center of Conversion will target provinces in specified regions and convert them to the Nestorian faith. A conversion can take between §Y12§! and §Y36 months§! depending on the province's development. \n\nEvery Nestorian country gains §YPatriarch Influence§!, which can be spent on the nine §YHoly Site§! interactions. \nEvery Holy Site interaction grants a different bonus, depending on whether the specific province is owned by you directly, by a different Nestorian country or a non-Nestorian country.

(circle buttons) and two §YLiturgical Focuses§! (inner buttons). You can pick one of the two Liturgical Focuses for the lifespan of your ruler. The selected Liturgical Focus decides the bonuses of the Minor Focuses. Picking a Minor Focus does not have a monthly cost, but instead the amount of Purity decides whether you can have one, two or three Minor Focuses active at the same time. \n\nEvery §Y10 years§! you can use the interaction '§YCall upon the God of Knowledge§!' (left button), which costs §R20§! Purity and gives a bonus to [technology_cost], [idea_cost] and [culture_conversion_cost]."
 rce_startup_text_bogomilist: "§YBogomilist§! is a §lChristian§! faith that is situated in the Balkans.

These Aspects have a cooldown of either §Y10§! or §Y20 years§! and give you a countrywide or areawide bonus while also removing one building in a randomly selected, matching province. \n\nSince Church Aspects are a Vanilla DLC locked mechanic, to use this mechanic the £DLC_cs£ §YCommon Sense§! DLC is required.\n"
 rce_startup_text_hinduism: "§YHindu§! is a Vanilla §lDharmic§! faith. Its mechanic has been changed. \n\n§YHindu§! still uses the §YDeities§! mechanic: \n\n\n£rce_startup_screen_icon_hindu_mechanic£ \n\n\n\nHowever the mechanic has been expanded. The deities picked via the Vanilla system are now considered §YMinor Deities§!. Some Vanilla ones have been removed and new ones have been added, so the following Minor Deities are pickable now: §YGanesha§!, §YKali§!, §YSurya§!, §YHanuman§!, §YShakti§! and §YBuddha§!. Minor Deities give a small bonus while active as well as an additional bonus that depends on the selected §YMajor Deity§! and your dedication towards it. \n\nThere are three §YMajor Deities§!, each associated with a monarch power: §YBrahma§! (£adm£), §YVishnu§! (£dip£) and §YShiva§! (£mil£). The Major Deity can be chosen and swapped freely (outer circle buttons), but the dedication for a Major deity only grows while it's active. There are six levels of dedication in total per Major Deity. When the dedication progress reaches §Y100.0%§!, the next level is selected and the progress is reset to §Y0.0%§!. If you lose dedication, you can also lose a dedication level. \n\nEvery §Y2 years§! you can use the interaction '§YReset Minor Deity§!' (right square button) to unselect your current §YMinor Deity§!. \nEvery §Y20 years§! you can use the interaction '§YSpend Dedication§!' (left upper square button), which costs §R30§! dedication of the current active Major Deity and grants you a bonus for §Y20 years§!. The bonus depends on who your current Major Deity is. \nYou can enable and disable a toggle, the '§YDedication Focus§!' (left lower square button), which grants Monthly Level of Dedication Progress for the current active Major Deity in exchange for maluses. The higher your dedication is, the smaller the bonus and the higher the maluses will be. Disabling the toggle will also have negative consequences that become harsher the higher your dedication is. \n\nSince Deities are a Vanilla DLC locked mechanic and the mechanic was expanded upon, the £DLC_won£ §YWealth of Nations§! DLC is still required.\n"
 rce_startup_text_norse_pagan_reformed: "§YNorse§! is a Vanilla §lPagan§! faith. Its mechanic has been changed. \n\n§YNorse§! still uses the §YDeities§! mechanic: \n\n\n£rce_startup_screen_icon_norse_mechanic£ \n\n\n\nHowever the mechanic has been expanded. There are now up to §Y15§! deities to pick from, some locked behind requirements such as accepting other religions' mythologies into your own. \n\nAdditionally §Y3§! values have been added, each representing the influence of a specific norn. These values are affected by your actions and decide the §YEra§! you are in, which will change every §Y20 years§!. The §YEra§! affects the modifiers the deities give, meaning each deity has one base bonus, which is the same in every Era, and one bonus that depends on the current Era. Some deities also view a specific Era as their §YMain Era§!, which increases their base bonus during that Era. \n\nThe norns' influence can also be spent on an interaction '§YConsult the Runes§!'. This reduces the influence of every norn by §Y25§! and grants a random bonus together with a small countering malus for §Y10 years§!. \n\nSince Deities are a Vanilla DLC locked mechanic and the mechanic was expanded upon, the £DLC_won£ §YWealth of Nations§! DLC is still required.\n"
 rce_startup_text_hellenism: "§YHellenistic§! is a §lPagan§! faith that does not exist on the map in 1444. Converting to §YHellenistic§! is possible via an event chain similar to the one of §YNorse§! in Vanilla and via rebels. \n\nThe event chain can happen to countries that meet the following requirements: \n   - current age is §YAge of Discovery§! \n   - primary culture is §YGreek§!, §YCappadocian§! or §YPontic§! or has at least \n     §Y50§! development in provinces with §YGreek§!, §YCappadocian§! or §YPontic§! \n     culture and has the respective culture accepted \n   - owns §Y[146.GetName]§! or is @BYZ §Y[BYZ.GetName]§! and owns §Y[151.GetName]§! \n   - is independent \n   - has embraced §YRenaissance§! or has a §YHellenistic§! advisor \n     (optainable via the £DLC_kok£ §YKing of Kings§!

They don't get automatically removed on ruler death, but can only be manually replaced once the ruler under which they have been selected has died. \nEach god also has a §Ytheme§! (§TCosmic§!, §MSea§!, §GNature§!, §YCulture§!, §OWarfare§!, §VLove§!, §RDeath§! or §lFate§!), which affects the effects of the interactions. \n\nEvery §Y10 years§! you can use the interaction '§YDedicate a new Temple§!' (upper right square button), which offers a selection of bonuses for a random owned province and your capital depending on the selected gods' themes. \nEvery §Y20 years§! you can use the interaction '§YHold Festivals for the Gods§!' (lower right square button), which grants a bonus that depends on the selected gods' themes. \n\nWhile you cannot normally replace a selected god under the same ruler under which the god was picked, you can use the interaction '§YRemove a Forsaken God§!' (left square button) to remove a god at the cost of §R1§! stability."
