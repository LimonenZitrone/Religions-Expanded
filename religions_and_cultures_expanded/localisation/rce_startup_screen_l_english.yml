Each ruler has its own Studies' Progress. The first teaching can be picked from the beginning of the ruler's reign. Any consecutive teaching can be picked, whenever the ruler reaches §Y100.0%§!

Otherwise the ruler will be simulated to ensure the Controller changes even without the Patriarchy country existing. \n[This.RceGetReligionMechanicNestorianPatriarchyPatriarchyControllerBonuses]  \n\nThe §YPatriarchy Controller§! also gains access to the ability to pick a §YCenter of Conversion§! that is active until the next Controller is picked or the Controller was forced by war to destroy it. \nOnce selected, the Center of Conversion will target provinces in specified regions and convert them to the Nestorian faith.

Picking a Minor Focus does not have a monthly cost, but instead the amount of Purity decides whether you can have one, two or three Minor Focuses active at the same time. \n\nEvery §Y10 years§! you can use the interaction '§YCall upon the God of Knowledge§!' (left button), which costs §R20§! Purity and gives a bonus to [technology_cost], [idea_cost] and [culture_conversion_cost]."

These Aspects have a cooldown of either §Y10§! or §Y20 years§! and give you a countrywide or areawide bonus while also removing one building in a randomly selected, matching province. \n\nSince Church Aspects are a Vanilla DLC locked mechanic, to use this mechanic the £DLC_cs£ §YCommon Sense§! DLC is required.\n"
 rce_startup_text_hinduism: "§YHindu§! is a Vanilla §lDharmic§! faith. Its mechanic has been changed. \n\n§YHindu§! still uses the §YDeities§! mechanic: \n\n\n£rce_startup_screen_icon_hindu_mechanic£ \n\n\n\nHowever the mechanic has been expanded. The deities picked via the Vanilla system are now considered §YMinor Deities§!. Some Vanilla ones have been removed and new ones have been added, so the following Minor Deities are pickable now: §YGanesha§!, §YKali§!, §YSurya§!, §YHanuman§! and §YBuddha§!. Minor Deities give a small bonus while active as well as an additional bonus that depends on the selected §YMajor Deity§! and your dedication towards it. \n\nThere are three §YMajor Deities§!, each associated with a monarch power: §YBrahma§! (£adm£), §YVishnu§! (£dip£) and §YShiva§! (£mil£). The Major Deity can be chosen and swapped freely (outer circle buttons), but the dedication for a Major deity only grows while it's active. There are six levels of dedication in total per Major Deity. When the dedication progress reaches §Y100.0%§!, the next level is selected and the progress is reset to §Y0.0%§!. If you lose dedication, you can also lose a dedication level. \n\nEvery §Y2 years§! you can use the interaction '§YReset Minor Deity§!' (right square button) to unselect your current §YMinor Deity§!. \nEvery §Y20 years§! you can use the interaction '§YSpend Dedication§!' (left upper square button), which costs §R30§! dedication of the current active Major Deity and grants you a bonus for §Y20 years§!. The bonus depends on who your current Major Deity is. \nYou can enable and deable a toggle, the '§YDedication Focus§!' (left lower square button), which grants Monthly Level of Dedication Progress for the current active Major Deity in exchange for maluses. The higher your dedication is, the smaller the bonus and the higher the maluses will be. Disabling the toggle will also have negative consequences that become harsher the higher your dedication is. \n\nSince Deities are a Vanilla DLC locked mechanic and the mechanic was expanded upon, the £DLC_won£ §YWealth of Nations§! DLC is still required.\n"
