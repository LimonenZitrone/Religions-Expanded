Major compatibility issues here mean that the mod will be [b]unplayable[/b] for the most part. Mods that change or add religions will most likely clash with the religions added in this mod, same applies to mods editing Vanilla cultures. Mods replacing the mentioned interface files will lead to many new mechanics not being usuable.
Medium and minor compatibility issues here mean that the mod will be playable for the most part, but [b]certain features will not work correctly[/b]. Some things might be missing or not work as intended.

[h1]Credits[/h1]
[list]
[*] some graphics were taken from [i]Crusader Kings III[/i] and then changed
[/list]
